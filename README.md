# 🐋 Plane Orca (Custom Fork)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Plane Orca** is our customized team fork of upstream [Plane Community Edition](https://github.com/makeplane/plane).

### ✨ Fork Features

Plane Orca enhances official Plane Community Edition with extended workflow capabilities, automations, and streamlined self-hosting:

| Category               | Feature                            | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **🔄 Parallel Cycles** | Multi-Active Cycles                | Run multiple active cycles simultaneously in a single project with manual start, pause, and complete controls.                                           |
|                        | Auto-Complete & Transfer           | Automatically finish cycles on their end date and easily transfer unfinished work items between cycles.                                                  |
| **🏷️ Global Taxonomy** | Shared Workspace Labels & States   | Create and maintain standardized issue states and labels at the workspace level across all team projects.                                                |
| **⚡ Automations**     | Conventional Commits Auto-Labeling | Automatically assigns conventional labels (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`, etc.) based on title prefixes, with on-activation backfill.       |
| **🚀 Productivity**    | Quick Copy Details                 | Copy work item title and clean, single-spaced formatted description from context menus in one action.                                                    |
|                        | Form Value Retention               | Preserves user input across creation forms when using "Create More".                                                                                     |
|                        | Enhanced Bulk Operations           | Multi-select and update work item properties with clear, streamlined multi-value dropdowns.                                                              |
| **🛠️ Data Migration**  | Plane-to-Plane Migration Tool      | Built-in CLI migration utility ([tools/migration](./tools/migration/README.md)) to migrate issues, cycles, labels, and projects between Plane instances. |
| **🎨 UI & Privacy**    | Clean & Distraction-Free UI        | Removed telemetry trackers and promotional ads for a faster, clutter-free workspace.                                                                     |
| **🐳 Self-Hosting**    | VPS & PaaS Ready                   | Optimized low-memory footprint stack ([docker-compose-orca.yml](./docker-compose-orca.yml)) running smoothly under 3GB RAM.                              |

### 🐳 Self-Hosted Deployment (`docker-compose-orca.yml`)

Plane Orca is pre-configured for self-hosting on low-spec VPS instances (<3GB RAM) using [docker-compose-orca.yml](./docker-compose-orca.yml). It is a plain Compose file: anything that runs Compose runs it — `docker compose up` on a VPS, or a PaaS that consumes a Compose file, such as Coolify.

#### ⚡ Quick Start

Whatever runs the stack, three things have to be true:

1. **The Compose file is the deployment unit**: point the platform (or `docker compose -f`) at `docker-compose-orca.yml` on the `stage` or `prod` branch. The images come from GHCR; see `ORCA_IMAGE_REPOSITORY` and `TAG` below.
2. **Public traffic reaches the `proxy` service on container port `80`**: route your domain (e.g. `https://plane.example.com`) there, and set `TRUSTED_PROXIES` to the CIDR of whatever sits in front of it — the stack refuses to start without it, on purpose, so that client IPs in logs and rate limits cannot be forged.
3. **Secrets are set as environment variables** before the first boot, not after.

<details>
<summary>Worked example: Coolify</summary>

1. **Create Application**: Add a new **Docker Compose** resource pointing to this repository (`stage` or `prod` branch) with file path `docker-compose-orca.yml`.
2. **Assign Domain**: In **Domains**, route your URL to the **`proxy`** service on container port `80`. Coolify is also what supplies `SERVICE_FQDN_PROXY`, the default `DOMAIN_NAME` resolves from — set `DOMAIN_NAME` explicitly anywhere else.
3. **Configure Secrets & Deploy**: Add the required secrets in **Environment Variables** and click **Deploy**.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> The deploy jobs in `.github/workflows/{stage,prod}.yml` call the Coolify API and are opt-in through the `COOLIFY_DEPLOY_ENABLED` variable; leave it unset and the workflows still lint, test, build and publish, while the deploy step is skipped. The 4UM deployment target is not yet decided (P0.17 in [the platform hardening plan](./docs/plans/orca-work-management/P0-platform-hardening.md)) — record it here once it is.

> [!TIP]
> **Generate Secret Keys**: Run `openssl rand -hex 32` in your terminal to generate 64-character secret keys.

### 🚀 Fork Workflow & Git Strategy

| Branch      | Purpose                                                                                             | Source Branch          | Merge Target       | Environment                       |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `upstream`  | **Upstream Mirror**: Tracks unmodified official Plane CE releases (`master` branch).                | _None (upstream sync)_ | _None (read-only)_ | N/A                               |
| `stage`     | **Staging/Integration**: Custom features, branding, and configs are integrated here.                | `stage`                | `stage`            | Staging / QA                      |
| `prod`      | **Production Releases**: Deployed directly to our self-hosted Plane instance for team-internal use. | `stage`                | `prod`             | Production (Internal Self-Hosted) |
| `feature/*` | **Feature Development**: Working branches for custom tasks and fixes.                               | `stage`                | `stage`            | Local Dev / Preview               |

- **Development Rules**: Please read and follow [FORK.md](./FORK.md) and [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) closely.
  - Use the conventional commit format: `feat(orca):`, `fix(orca):`, `style(orca-ui):`, `style(orca):`, `docs(orca):`, `chore(orca):`, or `refactor(orca):`.
  - Do not edit database migration files or drop core tables directly.
  - All files must adhere to standard monorepo styling rules and preserve existing license headers.
