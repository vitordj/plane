| Entity / Resource           | Migrated? | Notes / Behavior                                                                                                              |
| :-------------------------- | :-------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Projects**                |  ✅ Yes   | Recreated with the same name, identifier, and description.                                                                    |
| **Project Settings**        |  ✅ Yes   | Toggles for cycle, module, page, views, and intake layouts are synced.                                                        |
| **Workflow States**         |  ✅ Yes   | Syncs custom project workflow states (name, color, group). Maps issues to their correct state.                                |
| **Project Labels**          |  ✅ Yes   | Syncs custom project labels (name, color, description). Maps issues to their correct labels.                                  |
| **Cycles**                  |  ✅ Yes   | Recreated with name, description, start date, and end date.                                                                   |

| **Views**                   |   ❌ No   | Saved views are not migrated. They require session authentication instead of API tokens.                                      |
| **Project Pages**           |   ❌ No   | Pages are not migrated. They require session authentication instead of API tokens.                                            |
| **Embedded Images / Files** |   ❌ No   | Inline images/files in issue descriptions are not re-uploaded; original URLs are preserved as-is in the description HTML.     |
| **User Stickies**           |   ❌ No   | Workspace sticky notes are not migrated.                                                                                      |

## Part 1: Pre-create User Accounts (On the Server hosting the new Plane database)

To assign issues, module leads, and project roles to the correct users, their email accounts must exist in the target database first. We can automate querying the old server and seeding them using `create_users.py`.

Because this script directly writes to the database using the Django ORM, **it must be run inside the new Plane container on your server**.

### Step A: Run from your server shell (via Docker pipe)

Run this command on your hosting server terminal where the container is running:

```bash
docker exec -i <new-plane-api-container-name> python3 - < tools/migration/create_users.py
```

_(If you are using Coolify, replace `<new-plane-api-container-name>` with the name of the container running your new Plane `api` service)._

### Step B (Alternative): Manual Copy-Paste inside the container

If you are already inside the container shell (`docker exec -it <container> sh`):

1. Run `cat > create_users.py` inside the container shell.
2. Paste the contents of `tools/migration/create_users.py` into the terminal.
3. Press `Ctrl + D` to save the file.
4. Run `python3 create_users.py`.
5. Remove the temp file when done: `rm create_users.py`.

### First sign-in

Pre-created accounts have **no usable password**. They exist so that issues,
leads and roles can point at a real user; the person gets in through Microsoft
Entra ID, or through a magic link sent to the address the account was created
with. Both verify the address before granting the session, so there is no
shared secret to distribute — or to rotate later.

### If this script ran before this version

Earlier revisions of `create_users.py` set every created account to the same
hard-coded password, which was committed to this repository. Any environment
where that version ran has accounts an outsider can sign into. Invalidate them:

```bash
docker exec -it <plane-api-container> python3 manage.py shell
```

```python
from plane.db.models import User

# The accounts the script created — filter by the migrated addresses, or by the
# window in which you ran it.
emails = ["someone@example.com", "another@example.com"]
affected = User.objects.filter(email__in=emails)
# Alternatively: User.objects.filter(created_at__date="2026-08-30")

for user in affected:
    user.set_unusable_password()
    user.is_password_autoset = True
    user.save(update_fields=["password", "is_password_autoset"])
print(f"invalidated {affected.count()} accounts")
```

Then review the authentication logs for the period between the migration and
this change, looking for sign-ins to those accounts that the person themselves
does not recognize.

## Part 2: Run the Migration Script (On your local machine / client machine)

The data migration script (`migrate_data.py`) communicates purely over Plane's HTTP APIs, meaning **you can run it on your local developer machine** without having server access.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have python virtual environment set up and dependencies installed:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment in the tools directory
python3 -m venv tools/migration/.venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source tools/migration/.venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Make sure to add the following block to your `.env` file at the root of the project:

```env
# Migration Settings
MIGRATION_OLD_PLANE_URL="https://your-old-plane-domain.com"
MIGRATION_OLD_API_TOKEN="your-old-api-token"
MIGRATION_OLD_WORKSPACE_SLUG="your-old-workspace-slug"

MIGRATION_NEW_PLANE_URL="https://your-new-orca-domain.com"
MIGRATION_NEW_API_TOKEN="your-new-api-token"
MIGRATION_NEW_WORKSPACE_SLUG="your-new-workspace-slug"
```

### 3. Run the Script

Ensure your virtual environment is active, then run the script:

```bash
# If not already activated:
source tools/migration/.venv/bin/activate

# Run the script
python tools/migration/migrate_data.py
```
